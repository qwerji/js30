>[30 days of vanilla JavaScript projects.](http://js30.bentswanson.com)

The purpose of this project is to complete all of the prompts on [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), but without watching the tutorials before building the project. This is because the tutorial may go about the project in a different way than I would have originally thought to. To keep things real, I build the project based on the first few seconds of the video, and then once it is completed I watch the video to see what it might have done differently. 
Learning!
